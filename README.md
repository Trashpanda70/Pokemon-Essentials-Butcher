# Pokemon-Essentials-Butcher

A script allowing for the easy creation of a simple butcher event. Includes the ability to exclude certain Pokemon (so they cannot be given away) and make it so certain types cannot be sold. There are 3 levels that types can fall into (4 including the level that provides no money), and these levels determine how much money the trainer will get. The money given is a the weight of the Pokemon in centimeters multiplied by a constant the user specifies. This constant is determined by which level the Pokemon's type falls into. Instructions on how to customize the script and create the event are in block comments in the script. 

Currently only calculations can be done according to the height of a Pokemon, and if I can figure out how to do them using the weight then I will update with that functionality.

To get the script to work, create a new script section above the main and simply paste the code in.

Works with Essentials 19 (not sure about anything before that)
